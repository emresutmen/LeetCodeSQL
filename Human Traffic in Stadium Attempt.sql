visit_date is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the visit date and visit id to the stadium with the number of people during the visit.
No two rows will have the same visit_date, and as the id increases, the dates increase as well.
 

Write an SQL query to display the records with three or more rows with consecutive id's, and the number of people is greater than or equal to 100 for each.

Return the result table ordered by visit_date in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Stadium table:
+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | visit_date | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 1    | 2017-01-01 | 10        |
| 2    | 2017-01-02 | 109       |
| 3    | 2017-01-03 | 150       |
| 4    | 2017-01-04 | 99        |
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-09 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+
Output: 
+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | visit_date | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-09 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+
Explanation: 
The four rows with ids 5, 6, 7, and 8 have consecutive ids and each of them has >= 100 people attended. Note that row 8 was included even though the visit_date was not the next day after row 7.
The rows with ids 2 and 3 are not included because we need at least three consecutive ids.

SELECT s1.id, s1.visit_date, s1.people
FROM Stadium s1
JOIN Stadium s2 ON s1.id = s2.id - 1
JOIN Stadium s3 ON s1.id = s3.id - 2
WHERE s1.people >= 100 AND s2.people >= 100 AND s3.people >= 100
ORDER BY s1.visit_date ASC;

/* 1 -join the Stadium table with itself three times to get the three consecutive rows that we need. We use aliases s1, s2, and s3 to differentiate between the three tables.
2 - specify the conditions in the WHERE clause: we only want rows where each of the three consecutive rows has at least 100 people in attendance.
3-  order the results by visit_date in ascending order, as specified in the problem statement.*/
